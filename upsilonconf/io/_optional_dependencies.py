    """
    Decorator factory for functions that provide optional features.

    The decorators produced by this decorator factory aim
    to capture any import errors that might occur
    as a result of optional dependencies not being installed.
    If the import statement fails, an `OptionalDependencyError` is raised
    with a (hopefully) more meaningful error message.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature : str, optional
        A description of the optional feature that could fail.
        This description should complete the sentence
        "You have to install a package to ...".
        If no description is provided, a generic description is used.
    package : str, optional
        The name of the package that needs to be installed
        to make use of the optional features.
        By default, the module name is used to identify the package.
        However, sometimes there might be a (slight) difference.

    Returns
    -------
    _decorator : callable
        A decorator for wrapping functions with imports of optional dependencies.
        This wrapper will raise an `OptionalDependencyError` if the import fails.

    Raises
    ------
    OptionalDependencyError
        If the optional dependency is not satisfied.
